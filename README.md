Data Mining Semester Project

## Project Description
This project aims to answer four questions realted to ultramarathon racing and training. Through data analysis these questions are answered and there are even some additional information gained secondary to the questions answered.

### Questions and Results
1. What are the average paces sustained over ultramarathons for finishers?

The average paces sustained over ultramarathons of 50 km was 8.13 minutes per kilometer, 80 km (50 mi) was 8.87 minutes per kilometer, 100 km was 9.13 minutes per kilometer, and 160 km (100 mi) was 10.45 minutes per kilometer. In general as the race distance gets longer, the average pace slows down. This could be explained by the body having to slow down to keep up the activity level for these races that can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days.


2. What are the average paces of the top 20% of the field in each race distance? 

The average paces of the top 20% of the field per race distance are -11.36 minutes per kilometer for 50 km, 11.85 minutes per kilometer for 80 km, 13.23 minutes per kilometer for 100 km, and 13.51 minutes per kilometer for 160 km. In general the same conculsion is found with the average pace for the whole field, and that is as the distance gets longer, the paces slow down slighltly.


3. What year(s) had the most finishers with paces in the top 20% of the field per race distance? 

For the top 20% of the field, genreally there were separate years. The exception to this was the 50 km and 160 km races. This was most liekly a coincidence, but could have been due to extraneous factors not mentioned within the dataset. The most finishers for 50 km and 160 km races was 2018. For 80 km races, the year with the most finishers was 2022. For 100 km races, the year with the most finishers was 2016. 


4. What outliers are there with pace for finishing certain distance ultramarathons?

There were outliers for every distance, but there were more outliers for the shorter distances than the longer ones. As the length of the race increased, the amount of outliers decreased. This could be due to shorter races being more popular or cutoff times during the race are more forgiving, and thus more variations in pace are allowed. In longer races, generally, cutoffs are more strict, thus allowing for less variations in pace that are allowed to be able to finish the race.

## Applications

The knowledge gained from the results can be applied in three ways. One of those ways is that the average pace data can be used to help someone plan their race according to the average pace for the race distance they are going to run. Average pace tells someone a lot about how fast they need to run across the race in order to finish. From the average pace starting point, they could strategize how to cover different types of terrain and what are realistic paces for covering that terrain. These could all factor into meeting the average pace. From there, they could customize this to their goal pace.

Secondly, the knowledge gained from recognizing the top 20% of the field per race distanceâ€™s average pace is that runners, especially those close to or in the top 20% of their race field could use this average pace to plan their personal race pace. Of course, they would still also have to factor in percent grade of the terrain just the same as those basing their race based on average pace for the whole field per the specific race distance. Additionally, this information could give those in or near the top 20% an idea of what pace they need to train at or work up to before the race to be competitive during the actual race.

A third application of the results is that knowing the upper and lower bounds of the standard deviation is also helpful in planning race paces, but also in predictions for finish times according to sports broadcasters. There are races that put on a broadcast of the race and even predictions of races about who will place where. This information about the upper and lower bounds could help broadcasters to make realistic predictions about who will finish and when by making sure the paces fall in between these two bounds unless they know of people who are exceptions to those ranges. Additionally, standard deviations can help runners predict if their training paces are sound to focus on finishing a race, regardless of performance. Many ultramarathons have strict cutoff times throughout the race, and knowing if their paces fall outside the average range could help them adjust their pace as need during the race so that they meet the checkpoints under certain cutoff times.
